## Overview

This project leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, specifically OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 via the OpenAI API, combined with multiple APIs from **RapidAPI**, to analyze LinkedIn profiles, recommend suitable jobs, and provide salary benchmarks. The tool empowers users to identify tailored career opportunities, negotiate salaries confidently, and avoid undervaluation during interviews.

## Features

- **LinkedIn Profile Scraping**: Retrieves detailed user profiles using the LinkedIn Scraper API (via RapidAPI).
- **LLM-Driven Analysis**: Uses GPT-4 through OpenAIâ€™s API to analyze profiles and suggest tailored job titles, roles, and skills based on the extracted data.
- **Real-Time Job Matching**: Searches for recently published job postings that closely match the userâ€™s profile and suggested roles, using the Job Search API (via RapidAPI).
- **Salary Benchmarking**: Provides salary insights based on the job title, location, and industry using the Glassdoor Salary API (via RapidAPI).

## How It Works

1. **Profile Scraping**
   - The user provides their LinkedIn profile URL.
   - The tool scrapes the profile data using the LinkedIn Scraper API (via RapidAPI).

2. **Profile Analysis with LLM**
   - The scraped profile data is processed via OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 API to identify key skills, experiences, and potential job matches.
   - Suggestions include tailored job titles, relevant keywords for job searches, and actionable insights.

3. **Job Matching**
   - The tool searches for available job opportunities using the Job Search API (via RapidAPI).
   - Matches are based on the roles suggested by GPT-4, as well as the userâ€™s preferences for location, industry, and keywords.

4. **Salary Insights**
   - The Glassdoor Salary API (via RapidAPI) is used to fetch expected salaries for the suggested roles, factoring in the location and industry.
   - This helps users negotiate confidently and avoid undervaluation.
